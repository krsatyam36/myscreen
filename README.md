# myscreen
Wrapper around scrcpy/adb for smooth wireless screen mirroring


# myscreen

`myscreen` is a tiny Bash wrapper around [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and `adb` that makes **wireless screen mirroring** to your Android device effortless.  

Instead of typing long `adb connect` commands or remembering scrcpy flags, just run one command:  

```bash
./myscreen.sh
